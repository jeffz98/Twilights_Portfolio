## About The Project

This project was put together to create a space in which I could showcase my work in the CS field and let potential employers have a way to reach out to me. It incoporates basic html and css elements with use of flexbox. It will definitely be updated in the future in both visual and functionality aspects to improve the site. 

## Built With

HTML, CSS, Git.
